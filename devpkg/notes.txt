Why not use SQlite for the database? saving as a dat file seems insecure. unencrypted. 

Does it matter, though?
Hmm.

Aren't gotos bad? Is there a better way to do error handling?

Some lines are kind of unreadable. Abstracting them into functions might be a better option on some lines like commands.c:21. For loops are kind of difficult to understand. 
If statements are cluttered and almost unreadable. 


Why is Shell extern if you're only accessing it in Shell.c? Maybe you're using them in main. hmm.

Maybe enumerate return values to be more clear. 

not dynamic build locations! i guess you can change that with an options file, but not being able to choose where things install is a problem!
